This project will be undertaken from an *explicitly* immanent polytheist and ["post-recon"](https://axeandplough.com/2020/05/23/post-recon-what-happens-next/) point of view. The *Dēu̯oi* explored here are to be viewed as real, individual entities with agency. 

*Mantalon U̯ari·Celton* is an explicitly antifascist and universalist project. Any use of this site's content in any other context context is unsanctioned and will be met with resistance.

Update 06/29/2020: In the interest of providing a more cohesive and comprehensive framework for Reconstructionist Continental Celtic polytheists, as well as for a number of other reasons, this site is now officially affiliated with [Senobessus Bolgon](https://senobessusbolgon.wordpress.com/). This site will maintain its autonomy and scope, but will work very closely with *and within* Senobessus Bolgon on reconstructing fundamental theology and metaphysics, as well as exploring related cults shared between the two regions. The navigation has been expanded to include links to such pieces as have already been written by the team at Senobessus Bolgon.
