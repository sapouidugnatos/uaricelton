This project will be undertaken from an *explicitly* immanent polytheist and ["post-recon"](https://axeandplough.com/2020/05/23/post-recon-what-happens-next/) point of view. The *Dēu̯oi* explored here are to be viewed as real, individual entities with agency. 

*Mantalon U̯ari·Celton* is an explicitly antifascist and universalist project. Any use of this site's content in any other context context is unsanctioned and will be met with resistance.
