----------

*Note: While \*Bussumāros and \*Bussurīgios may very well have had separate cults, the close relationship between the two is almost undeniable, and so for the purpose of this piece, they will be addressed together, usually under the reconstructed form \*Bussumāros, because it is the reconstructed form of the variant with a higher-number of attestations.* 

Among the Southeastern Celts[^1], and even, surprisingly, among the Noric-Pannonians and the Boii[^2], there exists an otherwise unattested theonymic formula which consists of the element *\*bussu-*, usually taken to mean 'lip', 'penis', and probably others, juxtaposed with a following superlative, either *\*-mār(i)os* 'big, great' or *\*-rigios* 'royal'.  The attested variants vary from IOM Bussumarius and Deo Bussumario to IOM/Zeus Bussurigius and Sol Bussurigius. Due to the uncertain nature of the semantic meaning of *\*bussu-*, the interpretations of these theonyms and their associated cult(s) are many and varied:

- Delamarre and de Bernardo Stempel, for example, take the theonym to mean "with big lips" or "big prick"[^3] 

- For Prósper, however, the element *\*bussu-* is unrelated to either 'lip' or 'penis', and can be derived from *\*b<sup>h</sup>ud<sup>h</sup>-tu-* 'offering'. *\*Bussumāros* would then mean 'rich in presents', or 'great by his presents', and likely would indicate a "fortune dispensing" deity.[^4] 

- According to Lambert, the attested *Bussumarius* isn't an attributive epithet at all and must be interpreted as a pseudo-genitive construction formed with *\*-yo-*, i.e. IOM *of* Bussumāros.[^5] The same, presumably, could also be applied to *Bussurigius* in that case, i.e. Sol/IOM/Zeus *of* Bussurīgos.[^6] 

- Olmsted classifies both *\*Bussumāros* and *\*Bussurīgios* together as bynames for a Continental Celtic 'Sky Father' and notes the similarity to some epithets of Índraḥ, which apparently derive from Índraḥ's habitual consumption of  sṓma,[^7] a drink which was likely originally prepared with cannabis.[^8] This interpretation would then suggest that *\*Bussumāros* had a connection with intoxication and possibly divination. 

- Piqueron derives *\*Bussumāros* from *\*buđđu-*, which he defines as carrying the "phallic" connotations, or perhaps associations with the "tree of life".[^9] 

The most compelling interpretation, however, is one that seems to have flown under the radar. The element *\*bussu-* or *\*buzdo-* may ultimately be derived[^10] from the PIE *\*g<sup>w</sup>os-*,[^11] terms derived from which have a plethora of meanings including 'branch', 'twig', 'stick', 'spear', 'spoke', 'rod', or (possibly) 'penis'. This interpretation may very well reconcile the Zeus-Iuppiter-Sol *interpretatio* trichotomy that make up the *\*Bussumāros* / *\*Bussurīgios* epigraphic corpus. Of particular interest here are the semantic variants which refer to parts or aspects of a wheel. *\*Bussumāros* / *\*Bussurīgios* might then refer to the "great wheel" or "kingly wheel", referring either to the Sun, or possibly to the motion of the cosmos as a whole.[^12] This also fits well with Lambert's assertion of a quasi-genitive construction, meaning something like "Zeus / Iuppiter / Sol of the Great/Royal Wheel". This may well be reflected in the wheel imagery typically associated with *Taranis*, a deity who was also compared with Iuppiter. 

Through *inter alia*,[^13] it becomes clear that *\*Bussumāros* / *\*Bussurīgios* is a polyvalent cosmic celestial deity who rules the "turning" of the heavens and the daytime sky, is generally benevolent and beneficiary, and may embody aspects of masculinity and divination.
