Among the Southeastern Celts[^1], and even, surprisingly, among the Noric-Pannonians and the Boii[^2], there exists an otherwise unattested theonymic formula which consists of the element *\*bussu-*, usually taken to mean 'lip', 'penis', and probably others, juxtaposed with a following superlative, either *\*-mār(i)os* 'big, great' or *\*-rigios* 'royal'.  The attested variants vary from IOM Bussumarius and Deo Bussumario to IOM/Zeus Bussurigius and Sol Bussurigius. Due to the uncertain nature of the semantic meaning of *\*bussu-*, the interpretations of these theonyms and their associated cult(s) are many and varied. Delamarre, for example, takes the theonym to mean "with big lips".[^3] For Prósper, however, the element *\*bussu-* is unrelated to either 'lip' or 'penis', and can be derived from *\*b<sup>h</sup>ud<sup>h</sup>-tu-* 'offering'. *\*Bussumāros* would then mean 'rich in presents', or 'great by his presents', and likely would indicate a "fortune dispensing" deity.[^4] According to Lambert, the attested *Bussumarius* isn't an attributive epithet at all and must be interpreted as a pseudo-genitive construction formed with *\*-yo-*, i.e. IOM *of* Bussumarus.[^5] The same, presumably, could also be applied to *Bussurigius* in that case, i.e. Sol/IOM/Zeus *of* Bussurīgos.[^6] Olmsted, however, classifies both *\*Bussumāros* and *\*Bussurīgios* together as bynames for a Continental Celtic 'Sky Father' and notes the similarity to some epithets of Índraḥ, which apparently derive from Índraḥ's habitual consumption of  sṓma,[^7] a drink which was likely originally prepared with cannabis.[^8] This interpretation would then suggest that *\*Bussumāros* had a connection with intoxication and possibly divination. The most compelling interpretation, however, is one that seems to have flown under the radar. The element *\*bussu-* or *\*buzdo-* may ultimately be derived[^9] from the PIE *\*g<sup>w</sup>os-*,[^10] terms derived from which have a plethora of meanings including 'branch', 'twig', 'stick', 'spear', 'spoke', 'rod', or (possibly) 'penis'.
