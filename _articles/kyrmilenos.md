In attempting to identify autochthonous Celtic cults of the Balkans, one is sure to run into the problem of the disorganized state of academia in the region. Potentially linguistically-Celtic material is often overlooked because it was incorrectly classified by earlier authors. This appears to be the case of the apparently Celtic theonym, \**Kurmilēnos*, which has been classified as Thracian for almost a century.[^1] The theonym is attested as an epithet of Apollo in an inscription from Ezerovo, Bulgaria which reads:

> *Θεω̃ Κυρμιλ(ηνω̃) Άπόλλο(νι) εὺχήν*.[^2]

On first glance, the theonym appears to almost certainly contain the Gaulish word \**curmi*, 'beer' or some other descendant of the Proto-Celtic \**kormi*.[^3] Beer consumption is widely attested among the Iron Age Celtic peoples, and beer deities seem to also be attested elsewhere in the *Keltiké*.[^4] This element is also attested onomastically in the personal names *Curmillus, Curmilla, Curmisso, and Curmi-sagius* as the well as the toponym *Curmiliaca*.[^5] This alone may justify the identification of \**Kurmilēnos* with Apollo, via the likely perceived health benefits of beer and fermented drinks in general in the Ancient World or perhaps a shared association with divination via inebriation. However, it is also important to identify the correlation between Celtic 'Apollo deities' and natural springs.[^6] This may indicate that the element \**curmi-* may have been meant to refer to a beer-like quality of the water in a hot spring, perhaps bubbling and tinted brown. Further, this connection becomes even more important when considering the original meaning of the PIE ancestor to the Celtic \**kormi*, something along the lines of 'boiling'.[^7] Intriguingly, nearby to the town of Ezerovo in Bulgaria, where the \**Kurmilēnos* inscription is from, there is in fact a mineral spring.[^8] All of this considered, it seems possible to propose two full etymologies for \**Kurmilēnos*: (a) \**korm-il-enos*,[^9] (with *\*-il-* being a diminutive or hypocoristic suffix) to the effect of 'the Master of the Simmering' or 'the Master of the Small Beer', or (b) \**kormi-lēnos*,[^10] meaning 'the Boiling Wood' or 'the Beer Wood', all likely referring to the mineral spring near Ezerovo. However, it would also be unreasonable to assume that the indigenous Celtic devotees of \**Kurmilēnos* did not recognize the possibility for multiple meanings of this theonym through a phenomenon which has already been covered by the present author before.[^11] As such, in a reconstructionist context, all interpretations of the the theonym \**Kurmilēnos* should be treated as valid until more definitive evidence is uncovered.
