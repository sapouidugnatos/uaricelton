In the recontruction of indigenous Celtic religions on a tribal or regional basis, indigenous theonyms can be fundamental. However, not all Celtic peoples left behind a wealth of epigraphic evidence for the names of their deities, and some, in fact, left behind virtually none. This roadblock, however, can potentially be circumvented through understanding of the syncretic phenomena that yield certain Latinate thonyms in predominately Celtic-speaking areas. This study will focus, namely, on the process of *explicatio vel translatio Latina a lingua Celtica*. *Explicatio vel translatio Latina a lingua Celtica* describes a process by which Latin dedicants in votive inscriptions likely applied Latin calques of Celtic theonyms as epithets to Mediterranean deities.[^1] 

This calls to mind the case of the *Scordisci*. Although the Celtic *Scordisci* left behind a wealth of personal names, toponyms, and evidence of material culture in the Central Balkans, they left behind virtually no epigraphic evidence of their deities.[^2] This does not, however, condemn one who would attempt a reconstruction of them. Take, for example, the case of the attested *MARS CAMPESTER* from the territory of the *Scordisci*. According to Gavrilović, it can neither be confirmed nor denied with present evidence (although it should certainly remain under suspicion in areas known to have been Celtic-speaking) whether or not the Moesian *MARS CAMPESTER* concealed an epichoric Celtic deity.[^3] However, as the saying goes, 'history gets a vote, not a veto'; progress can therefore proceed under the assumption that a certain degree of innovation is acceptable, expected, and often unavoidable in modern polytheist religions built with a reconstructionist methodology, and this short study can proceed with the assumption that the Moesian *MARS CAMPESTER* does, in fact, conceal an indigenous Celtic deity. 
    
If this is the case, then it can be immediately recognized that the deity in question has undergone what de Bernardo Stempel calls *explicatio vel translatio Latina a lingua Celtica*. In fact, an exact parallel to the *MARS CAMPESTER* in question may be seen in the example that de Bernardo Stempel uses to demonstrate this process, the *FATAE CAMPESTRES* of the Italian peninsula. De Bernardo Stempel connects this theonym via semantics to the *MATERES MAGEIAE* attested in France, and derives *MAGEIAE* from *\*mages-ya-* 'belonging to or related to a field'.[^4] From this, a reconstructed indigenous name for the Moesian *MARS CAMPESTER* can then be constructed as a masculine-singular theonym from the root \**mages-* and the masculine structural suffix *\*-yo-*, yielding \**Magesios* or a later \**Mageios*. It is worth noting hereafter, though, that this reconstruction depends heavily on the accuracy of de Bernardo Stempel's etymology, as both Delamarre and Matasović produce different morphologies for the root in question.[^5]
