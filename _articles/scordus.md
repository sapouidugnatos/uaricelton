It should come as no surprise that ancestral deities and hero cultussen are of paramount importance to the reconstruction of tribal praxes. Both are hyper-specific to certain tribal or other social groupings and allow for attachment to that identity in the modern era.[^1] This makes them invaluable to a reconstructed tradition, especially one as poorly attested as that of the *Scordisci*. Luckily enough, classical sources seem to indicate that such a deity existed for the *Scordisci*. According to Appian, 

> *"They say that the country \[of Illyria\] received its name from Illyrius, the son of Polyphemus; for the Cyclops Polyphemus and his wife, Galatea, had three sons, Celtus, Illyrius, and Galas, all of whom migrated from Sicily; and the nations called Celts, Illyrians, and Galatians took their origin from them. Among the many myths prevailing among many peoples this seems to me the most plausible. Illyrius had six sons, Encheleus, Autarieus, Dardanus, Mædus, Taulas, and Perrhæbus, also daughters, Partho, Daortho, Dassaro, and others, from whom sprang the Taulantii, the Perrhæbi, the Enchelees, the Autarienses, the Dardani, the Partheni, the Dassaretii, and the Darsii. Autarieus had a son Pannonius, or Pæon, and the latter had sons, Scordiscus and Triballus, from whom nations bearing similar names were derived..."*[^2]

This appears to be the only reference to the eponymous ancestor deity of the *Scordisci* in the classical literature. It should come as no surprise then, that this discussion also necessitates a discussion of onomastics and epigraphy. Firstly, as this discussion centers around an eponymous deity of the *Scordisci*, it is worth discussing the origin and meaning of *Scordisci* as an ethnonym; there are essentially two camps: de Bernardo Stempel suggests a wholly Celtic etymology meaning "the leather-dressers",[^3] while Falileyev suggests that the most likely etymology is a Celtic onomastic suffix applied to the non-Celtic IE word \**scordos*, as in *Scordus Mons*, a mountain range near where the *Scordisci* settled.[^4] Secondly, any epigraphic reference to a theonym related to \**scordos* or the *Scordisci* should be investigated. As it happens, there is only one. In 1993, M. Manov described an artifact that had been in the collection of the Bulgarian *Natsionalen Arheologicheski Muzey* for several decades and never published: a small stone Celtic votive object carved with 3 relief images. The first two, a horse rearing its front two legs and an anthropomorphic figure battling a large serpent, were catalogued when the artifact entered the museum's collection. The third and most crucial, however, was missed by the museum record-keepers who logged it and was identified for the first time by Manov. On one small side of the stone is carved a male head with long, parted hair. Inscribed next to it in Greek letters is the word *ΣΚΟΡΔΟΥ*, '(to) \**Scordos*'.[^5] This likely indicates that the theonym predates the ethnonym, which would lend some support to the conclusions of Falileyev. Were it vice versa, the theonym being derived from the ethnonym (as would be expected if the deity evolved from the process of Romanisation, such as the case with *Noreia* in Noricum[^6]), a form like Appian's *Scordiscus* would seem to be much more expected in an epigraphic context such as this.

Having established through classical accounts as well as epigraphy that there was indeed an eponymous ancestor deity of the *Scordisci*, it is then of paramount importance to wager an attempt at interpreting the symbolism that accompanies the inscription to Him. Firstly, it is fairly easy to establish the role of \**Scordos* as a heroic figure from the scene of the figure in combat with the serpent. The motif of a deity in combat with a serpent is attested with heroic deities from elsewhere in the *Keltiké*.[^7] Initially, the horse motif is striking as a symbol of sovereignty.[^8] This wouldn't be particularly surprising, as Heracles, often the subject of a Celtic hero cult, is attested twice separately in contemporary classical sources with relation to a "\[characteristically\] Celtic"[^9] sovereignty/ancestral myth. The first appears in the works of Diodorus Siculus,

> *"Now Celtica was ruled in ancient times, so we are told, by a renowned man who had a daughter who was of unusual stature and far excelled in beauty all the other maidens. But she, because of her strength of body and marvellous comeliness, was so haughty that she kept refusing every man who wooed her in marriage, since she believed that no one of her wooers was worthy of her. Now in the course of his campaign against the Geryones, Heracles visited Celtica and founded there the city of Alesia, and the maiden, on seeing Heracles, wondered at his prowess and his bodily superiority and accepted his embraces with all eagerness, her parents having given their consent. From this union she bore to Heracles a son named Galates, who far surpassed all the youths of the tribe in quality of spirit and strength of body. And when he had attained to man's estate and had succeeded to the throne of his fathers, he subdued a large part of the neighbouring territory and accomplished great feats in war. Becoming renowned for his bravery, he called his subjects Galatae or Gauls after himself, and these in turn gave their name to all of Galatia or Gaul."*[^10]

Similarly, Parthenius of Nicaea writes, 

> *"Hercules, it is told, after he had taken the kine of Geryones from Erythea, was wandering through the country of the Celts and came to the house of Bretannus, who had a daughter called Celtine. Celtine fell in love with Hercules and hid away the kine, refusing to give them back to him unless he would first content her. Hercules was indeed very anxious to bring the kine safe home, but he was far more struck by the girl’s exceeding beauty, and consented to her wishes; and then, when the time had come round, a son called Celtus was born to them, from whom the Celtic race derived their name."*[^11]

Both of these accounts are strikingly similar to the mythological genealogy of *Scordiscus* recorded by Appian, and should lead ultimately to the conclusion that the horse motif on the \**Scordos* votive stone represents the aspects of the cult of \**Scordos* related to sovereignty. 

These exact qualities of heroism and sovereignty may be reinforced in comparison with the Celtic heroic deity *Smertrios*, who bears the same serpent-slaying imagery as has been seen with \**Scordos*.[^12] Also crucial to this study is the fact that *Smertrios* has a direct connection to the most famous claim of Celtic ancestry made in the classical sources, that of Caesar:

> *"All the Gauls assert that they are descended from the god Dis, and say that this tradition has been handed down by the Druids."*[^13]

To the present author's knowledge, only one Celtic deity appears in epigraphy with *Dīs* in the context of *interpretatio*: *Smertrios*,[^14] whose striking iconographical resemblence to \**Scordos* has already been established. This seems to confirm quite plainly that the deity attested on Manov's Celtic votive object is the eponymous heroic, sovereign, ancestral deity of the *Scordisci* and not simply an anthropomoprhic deity of the *Scordus Mons*.

This does, however, beg the question as to whether or not the *Scordisci* viewed their tutelary deity as the deity of the *Scordus Mons* as well. This is certainly possible, given the modern understanding of the "ethnogenesis" of the *Scordisci* as a post-colonial and likely heterogenous entity[^15], i.e. since the *Scordisci* were categorized as such only by the Greco-Roman world by virtue simply of their being the *La Tène* "others" to the north of the Hellenistic southern Balkans, and not because they actually existed as a unified social, cultural, or political entity. According to Häussler, Celtic hero and ancestral cults develop as response to socio-political upheaval.[^16] This may indicate that the worship of \**Scordos* as a heroic ancestral deity began as a way of unifying the various tribal groups of the Central Balkans around their shared geography in the face of social upheaval caused by tribal migrations, the end of the Hallstatt social order in the Balkans, and Roman colonial aggression.[^17]
