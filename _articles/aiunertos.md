> The Scythians say that their nation is the youngest in the world, and that it came into being in this way. A man whose name was Targitaüs appeared in this country, which was then desolate. They say that his parents were Zeus and a daughter of the Borysthenes river (I do not believe the story, but it is told). Such was Targitaüs' lineage; and he had three sons: Lipoxaïs, Arpoxaïs, and Colaxaïs, youngest of the three. In the time of their rule (the story goes) certain implements—namely, a plough, a yoke, a sword, and a flask, all of gold—fell down from the sky into Scythia. The eldest of them, seeing these, approached them meaning to take them; but the gold began to burn as he neared, and he stopped. Then the second approached, and the gold did as before. When these two had been driven back by the burning gold, the youngest brother approached and the burning stopped, and he took the gold to his own house. In view of this, the elder brothers agreed to give all the royal power to the youngest.

> Lipoxaïs, it is said, was the father of the Scythian clan called Auchatae; Arpoxaïs, the second brother, of those called Katiari and Traspians; the youngest, who was king, of those called Paralatae. All these together bear the name of Skoloti, after their king; “Scythians” is the name given them by Greeks. This, then, is the Scythians' account of their origin...

\- *Herodotus 4.5-6*



In attempting to reconstruct the religious landscape of the Celto-Scythian[^1] Bastarnae, efforts are hamstrung by the absolute absence of epigraphically attested Bastarnian deities. This forces a creative approach within a "post-recon"[^2] framework. With an absence of attested material to work from, *new* material, i.e. "innovations", must be produced using both Celtic and Scythian material from outside the Bastarnae territory. A disclaimer must also be added that although inspired by the concept of a "Celto-Scythian" Bastarnae, this series can claim no historic continuity with the true, historic Bastarnae. The next step, then, is to lay out the "ground rules" for this innovation, in order to ensure congruency across its elements. Firstly, it would be entirely unreasonable to assume that a majority or even a sizable minority of the general population of Pontic Scythia had been Celticized. Thusly, it would be unreasonable to postulate that Celtic religious beliefs were adopted wholesale or even partially by the autochthonous population of Pontic Scythia. Therfore, the basis for the mythology and reconstructed deities of this tradition shall be what is currently known of Scythian mythology. There is then the issue of the tremendous gap of time between the Greek (Herodotean) writings on Scythian religion and the timeframe of Celticization on the Pontic Steppe. This, unfortunately, can only be resolved by admitting that using Herodotus' information is a necessity without any epigraphic material, as the Scythians were pre-literate. Finally, in keeping with the Celtic-speaking aspect of this greater "Eastern Celtic" project, religious terminology and theonyms will be presented through a syncretic phenomenon called *explicatio vel translatio*.[^3]



Having established the ground rules for this reconstruction, the natural place to begin is the mythical beginning of the Scythians themselves, as quoted above.[^4] The story presents four important characters: Targitaos, the progenitor of all the Scythians, and his three sons, Lipoxais, Arpoxais, and Kolaxais. All four serve narrative and cosmological functions.[^5] Targitaos is a fusion of opposites: sky and earth, settled and nomad, "above and below, male and female, warm and moist",[^6] etc., and was likely a heroic, Herculean figure. The three brothers represent fragmentation of Scythians into historical tribes, with Kolaxais, and his four celestial objects, also representing the unifying nature of the Royal Scythian kingship. Kolaxais' two brothers' submission to him is a narrative justification for the subordination of the, very much real, Scythian tribes who claimed descent from them to the Royal Scythians, the Paraltai.[^7]



Having established the mythological and cultic function of these figures as well as some symbology, the final step is to approach Celtic syncretism, starting with the theonyms:



| Scythian Theonym | Scythian Etymology                                           | Proposed Celtic Theonym                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Targitaos        | \**darga-tavah-* "He whose strength is long-lasting"[^8] or \**ptar-gaiϑānām* "father of mankind"[^9] | \**Ai̯unertos*[^13] "eternal strength" or \**Donicoater*[^14] "mankind father" |
| Lipoxais         | \**dvīpá-xs̆ay(a)-* "Ruler of the peninsula"[^10]             | \**Letoenistīrix*[^15] 'peninsula king'                      |
| Arpoxais         | \**álpa-xs̆ay(a)-* "Small king" or "Lesser king"[^11]         | \**Lou̯orix*[^16] "small/lesser king"                         |
| Kolaxais         | \**kŭdā-xs̆ay(a)-* "Ruler over all, i.e. Great king"[^12]     | \**Ollorix*[^17] "king of all"                               |



As a group, or "house", all four can be referred to as the \**Ai̯unertiscoi* "those of \**Ai̯unertos*".
