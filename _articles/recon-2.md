 *My deepest thanks to my colleagues from Senobessus Bolgon and Tegos Skrībbātous, a conversation between whom inspired this piece, and to my colleagues from the Heathen world. All inspire me to improve my nuanced thinking and think bigger than simple etymological understanding.*

 As the reconstruction of formerly poorly understood regional indigenous polytheisms develops,[^1] so too does the academia that allows for deeper understanding of these faiths. One such example of the two evolving in unison is the case of the reconstructionist concept of *inter alia* and the emerging onomastic concept of assonance names. *Inter alia*, as a reconstructionist concept, describes the process of incorporating all plausible scholarly interpretations of a deity's historical cult into the reconstructed cult of said deity. It is an approach that is often necessary in the reconstruction of poorly attested, or otherwise inconclusively explored, cults. Likewise, the terms *noms d’assonance* or assonance names, as described by Raepsaet-Charlier,[^2] represent a class of names (in this case personal names), which were Latin names chosen by indigenous persons upon gaining Roman citizenship on the basis of a double meaning between the Latin name and a phonologically similar indigenous lexeme as a means of enthusiastically integrating with Roman society while still maintaining their distinct indigenous identity. Although the original phenomenon was observed exclusively in relation to personal names, the same phenomenon may certainly extend to theonymic onomastics as well, according to Falileyev,[^3] who describes theonyms with equally plausible Latin and indigenous etymologies likely being Latin theonyms, the cult around which was influenced by its similarity to one or more indigenous roots or lexemes.

 For Falileyev, this is possibly the case with the Scordiscan deity, *Dea Orcia*, attested at Singidunum.[^4] Among the etymologies that Falileyev considers plausible, the first is that of Gaul. \**orco-* '(domestic/young) pig'.[^5] It is important to recognize that the cthonic and deathly role that boars/pigs played in at least Insular and Welsh mythological literature has been explored before.[^6] Second, Falileyev recognizes[^7] the possibility of an original form of the theonym as \**Orgia*,[^8] which may be supported either by de Bernardo Stempel's tentative suggestion that the name may be related to the root in the Cisalpine theonym *Orgenos*,[^9] *\*orget(o)* / *\*orgeno-* 'tueur' / 'meurtre', or a potential relation to Matasović's *\*orgyā* 'testicle', with obvious connotations of fertility or the cthonic either way.[^10] Finally, Falileyev seems to favor[^11] the suggestion that *Dea Orcia* 'could represent a *paredra* to the Roman Orcus, god of death and the underworld.'[^12] Gavrilović continues, 'Similar to Orcus, *Dea Orcia* may have had a cthonic aspect through which she would be associated with Terra Mater... Another possibility for finding a common aspect between \[*Dea Orcia* and Terra Mater\] lies in the worship of Terra Mater as a fertility goddes.'[^13] Falileyev also entertains the idea[^14] of a characteristically Celtic[^15] gender variation as an etymology, but finds that improbable, given that *Orcia* is 'derived according to the rules of Latin grammar.'[^16]


 Therefore, a portrait of the landscape of the cult of *Dea Orcia* seems to form: although the theonym is very possibly Latin etymologically, it is also very possibly Celtic, and it seems at least almost impossible for the indigenous population not to have connected this deity and Her cult with concepts known to them in indigenous roots and lexemes by *onomastic assonance*, all of which center around concepts of the cthonic, the protection of the dead, and fertility. Since these interpretations all agree, this case is a prime example of an acceptable use of *inter alia* for forming a more nuanced view of this deity's name and cult, as well as the ethno-religious transformations ocurring in the regional tribal groups during the Roman era, and its demonstration should help offer another route for reconstructionist polytheists to reconcile academic debate or inconclusive evidence in a progressive manner.
